I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley.

My research examines spatial inequality and the provision of local public goods. I also work on landlord market power and its implications for housing affordability.

### Working Papers

**The Welfare Effects of Decentralizing Public Goods** [draft forthcoming] (with Damien Capelle)

<p style="margin-left: 10px; font-size: 13px;"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper analyzes the welfare impacts of fiscal decentralization in France. Using detailed municipal budget data, we uncover significant heterogeneity in both the level and composition of public goods provision across localities. Additionally, we find that localities with varying income levels and population sizes systematically allocate their budgets differently across varieties of public goods. To explain these patterns, we develop a quantitative spatial equilibrium model featuring households with non-homothetic preferences over multiple public goods, heterogeneous public good rivalry, local voting on tax rates and public goods bundles, and federal transfers. Our simulations reveal significant welfare gains from decentralization, primarily driven by the ability to tailor the mix of public goods to local preferences and costs. Household mobility significant amplifies these gains. </p>

**Landlord Market Power and Housing Affordability: Evidence from a Large Online Rental Platform** [draft forthcoming]

<p style="margin-left: 10px; font-size: 13px;"><b>Abstract:</b> Is there significant market power in the U.S. rental housing market, and if so, what are its implications for housing affordability? This paper investigates these questions by developing a model of frictional housing search and estimating time-on-market elasticities as a proxy for individual landlords' demand curves. The empirical strategy leverages data on repeated rental vacancies from a large online rental platform spanning U.S. housing markets. I find widespread evidence of substantial market power among landlords. Consistent with theoretical predictions, these elasticities are inversely related to local landlord concentration and positively correlated with local vacancy rates. These findings indicate that market structure has significant implications for rental prices, enabling landlords to sustain higher rents and potentially exacerbating affordability challenges in many urban areas.
