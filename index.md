I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley.

My research examines spatial inequality and the provision of local public goods. I also work on landlord market power and its implications for housing affordability.

### Working Papers

Income Sorting and the Composition of Local Public Goods [draft forthcoming] (with Damien Capelle)

<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the relationship between residential sorting and the provision of local public goods in French municipalities. Using a detailed dataset on municipal budgets, we uncover significant heterogeneity in the levels and composition of public services across municipalities. Additionally, evidence from municipal "Engel curves" reveals that wealthier municipalities allocate a higher proportion of their budgets to public services such as education and youth-oriented programs, while poorer municipalities spend relatively more on the provision of social and administrative services. These patterns are suggestive of non-homothetic preferences, where households with different incomes exhibit varying tastes for public goods and different sensitivities to tax rates. To explain these patterns, we develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that incorporates non-homothetic household preferences over varieties of public goods, varying degrees of public good rivalry, and collective decision-making through local voting on tax rates and public goods provision. Our model also captures the role of federal transfers in shaping welfare, household sorting, and spatial inequality. The model's predictions are consistent with our empirical findings, and we use it to evaluate the impacts of decentralization policies and federal transfer designs on local welfare and inequality.</p>
