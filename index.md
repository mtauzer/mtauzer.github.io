I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley.

My research examines spatial inequality and the provision of local public goods. I also work on landlord market power and its implications for housing affordability.

### Working Papers

Income Sorting and the Composition of Local Public Goods [draft forthcoming] (with Damien Capelle)

<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 13px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the interaction between residential sorting and local public goods provision in French municipalities. Analyzing municipal budget data, we find significant heterogeneity in the level and composition of public goods across localities. Additionally, municipal "Engel curves" reveal that  areas with higher median incomes allocate a greater share of their budgets to education and youth programs, while poorer ones spend relatively more on social and administrative services. To explain these patterns, we develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model with non-homothetic household preferences over varieties of public goods, varying public good rivalry, and collective decision-making through local voting on tax rates and public goods provision. The model, consistent with our empirical findings, also considers the role of federal transfers in shaping welfare, sorting, and spatial inequality. We use this framework to evaluate the impacts of decentralization policies and federal transfer designs on welfare and spatial inequality. </p>

Landlord Market Power and Housing Affordability: Evidence from a Large Online Rental Platform [draft forthcoming]

<p style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 13px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Is there significant market power in the U.S. rental housing market, and if so, what are its implications for housing affordability? This paper investigates these questions by developing a model of frictional housing search and estimating time-on-market elasticities as a proxy for individual landlords' demand curves. The empirical strategy leverages data on repeated rental vacancies from a large online rental platform spanning U.S. housing markets. I find widespread evidence of substantial market power among landlords. Consistent with theoretical predictions, these elasticities are inversely related to local landlord concentration and positively correlated with local vacancy rates. These findings indicate that market structure has significant implications for rental prices, enabling landlords to sustain higher rents and potentially exacerbating affordability challenges in many urban areas.
